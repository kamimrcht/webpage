**Project Title: ESCALATE**

**Project Description**:

The ESCALATE project aims to advance cancer research by developing new methods to process and analyze RNA-seq data at the nucleotide level, enabling more detailed analysis than current gene-level summaries. This will allow researchers to identify novel RNA biomarkers and tumor-specific antigens across extensive datasets. With its innovative reference-free indexing and querying tools, ESCALATE will help uncover unique molecular changes in cancer, enhancing our understanding of the disease.

**Key Responsibilities**:

Develop and optimize algorithms and data structures scalable fine grained RNA quantification.
Collaborate with partner labs to integrate and apply new methods in cancer research.

**Required Skills**:

Expertise in sequence bioinformatics.
Proficient in development using compiled languages such as C, C++, or Rust.
Strong background in data structures and algorithm design.
